Pong is a classic video game that simulates a simple table tennis or ping-pong match. It was one of the earliest arcade games and was released in the 1970s. In Pong, two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, and their objective is to bounce a ball back and forth between them. The game is won by scoring points when one player fails to return the ball.
